# Python-APIs

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world  
of varying distance from the equator. Utilized a the OpenWeatherMap API to create  
a representative model of weather across 500 world cities.

Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  

    Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
